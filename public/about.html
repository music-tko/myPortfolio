                        My name is Thando, or you may know me by my nickname Thay, ThayDevToBe on Twitter. I'm a 19 year old girl forcing her way into the tech industry. Yep making a space for myself, not asking for one.
                        <br> Which is why I have this portfolio to prove my skills and well help you get to know me. I'm, what you call, a social butterfly who loves working with others, you get to learn so much from others.
                        <br> Although I love working alone so I can expand my mind in terms of finding new ways to solve problems. I'm the type of programmer who would think about the code hours after and figure it out when, 
                        <br> maybe, having breakfast. I would love to find out more about you, drop a DM or send your info in the contact form.

                    <p class="p-10 md:text-lg">My name is Thando Khoase but you can call me Thay, my first name meaning love. See the thing is development was never my first love, nor my passion.
                        <br> Wait, don't go just yet. It was neither of those things but I grew to love it so much that it didn't matter that it wasn't my first option. <br>
                    <br>From a young age I had loved fiddling with gadgets, from the family tv to fixing my grand mother's phone 
                    <br>(although I just needed to put it on General instead of Silent, but no one needs to know that.) But that was just it, I fiddled with computers. I didn't think of it long term. <br> 
                    <br>
                    I figured that I would end up in the entertainment industry, I have a passion for singing and acting but it was daunting to think I would have to study about something that I felt came naturally to me and something I loved with it's quirks and flaws. I was stuck. <br>
  
                    <br>
                    Insert 10th grade, my first taste of computer science with IGCSE. I was one of two girls in those exam centres, but I didn't let it bother me. <br>
                     I was intrigued by the subject, wanting to learn more about, I started going further than the curriculum.
                     
                     <br><br>Learning about logic gates and hexadecimals and binary code and woah, this was pulling me in further. <br>
                    As a lot of self-taught developers start, I started doing my research. Started learning how to design sites, using no code platforms, I started my freelancing journey in the 10th grade and I went from there. <br>
                    <br>
                    Fast forward to the beginning of this year, I had more time to research, I started learning Javascript. It felt insanely hard at first, then I broke it down in pieces and it started to slowly make sense. <br>
